# Finetuned-and-autoprompted-SAM-model-for-field-boundary-delineation
To do the edge detection for crop field with Sentinel-2 images. We proposed a SAM-based model with finetuned mask decoder and Deeplabv3-based prompt encoder which provide low-resolution crop field masks as prompt for segment anything model.
